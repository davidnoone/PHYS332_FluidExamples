If advection is evaluated using finite difference methods, a substantial amount of diffusion is needed to stabilize the numerical result. This is possible, but a more accurate scheme can also be used with better results. The stepping in time is done using a 3rd order scheme, rather than a simple single forward step, because it has some nice stability properties. This is accomplished using the weighted result from three applications of a simple forward Euler time step.\n",
