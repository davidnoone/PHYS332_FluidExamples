        "This module has introduces the wave equation, and numerical solutions for time evolving flows. The concept of the Courant number and limits on this for numerical problems is a fundemental limitation on selection of spatial (x) resolution for particular time steps. Higher spatial resolution requires smaller time steps, and this is limited by the computation power at hand. This partly means your patience to wait for a high resolution solution, but also the capcity in of the computer to store the reults! Notice that $nx \\times ntime$ is the number of numbers stored in the \"h\" array. And each number is 8 bytes. Wile not a big deal in 1d, in 3d, $nx \\times ny \\times nz \\times ntime\\times 8 $ bytes can add up quite quickly!\r\n",

As the amplitude grows with small wave speed (and small depth), we must at some point reconsider the linear assumtion, and the fact that we used small amplitude assumtion. At some point, we need to return to the linear equations, and more complex solution method. \r\n",
